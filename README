  1.  Introduction

  1.1.  General

  This document gives pointers for information on this package which is
  distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2 (see file
  COPYING).

  1.2.  What This Package Is

  The purpose of tsung is to simulate users in order to test
  the scalability and performances of IP based client/server
  applications.

  A User's manual is available :

  If you are into ejabberd testing, then change the following line
  in file src/tsung/ts_jabber_common.erl:
    "' xmlns='jabber:client' version='1.0' xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'>"]).
  to:
    "' xmlns='jabber:client' xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'>"]).
  and recompile.

  When ejabberd receives the "version='1.0'" attribute it requires
  compliance with the spec, hence it's no longer possible to use plain auth method.
  Changing that line solves the problem for load testing purposes.
